# StringEditor

This program continuously runs and presents the user with an option menu upon start up. The option menu prints different executable functions:
- Palindrome Check
  - Returns a boolean whether a user input string is a palindrome
- Anagram Check
  - Returns true if one string is the anagram of another string (“silent” is an anagram of “listen” and vice versa)
- Add Substring
  - Returns the substring added to the input string given a specified index
- Get Length
  - Returns the length of a given input string
- Count Occurances
  - Returns the number of occurrences a specified substring is in the input string
- Reverse Sentence
  - Returns only the sentence string in reverse order of words (input string is “This is a test.” which gives the return string, “test a       is This.”)

- Quit

This program uses both iterative and recursive methods to execute the above functions.
